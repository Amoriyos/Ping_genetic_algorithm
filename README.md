Ping: Human vs.Genetic algorithm 

This is me playing Ping against genetic algorithm (to the left).

The game is designed by David Buckingham for two player in Matlab, see link[1] below. 
I've modified the script slightly and automated the second player with genetic algorithm optimaiztion funtion in Matlab. 

As expected,  genetic algorithm  outperformed me even though its maximum speed 50% less than mine. I uploaded the m-file on github, see link [2].
